    Relative Factor of 2: The array size doubles when resized.

    Relative Factor of 1.5: The array size increases by 50% when resized.

    Fixed Size of 1024 (210210): The array size increases by 1024 elements when resized.

    Fixed Size of 8192 (213213): The array size increases by 8192 elements when resized.

    Fixed Size of 32768 (215215): The array size increases by 32768 elements when resized.

    Relative Factor of 2:

        Pros: Efficient for large lists, as the number of resizes grows logarithmically with list size.

        Cons: Can lead to significant memory waste for smaller lists due to large capacity jumps.

    Relative Factor of 1.5:

        Pros: Balances memory usage and resizing frequency better than the factor of 2.

        Cons: Slightly more resizes compared to the factor of 2, but less memory waste.

    Fixed Size of 1024 (210210):

        Pros: Predictable memory usage, suitable for small to medium lists.

        Cons: High number of resizes for large lists, leading to increased time and append copies.

    Fixed Size of 8192 (213213):

        Pros: Fewer resizes than 1024, better for medium-sized lists.

        Cons: Still inefficient for very large lists.

    Fixed Size of 32768 (215215):

        Pros: Minimal resizes, efficient for very large lists.

        Cons: High memory waste for small lists.


    Small Lists: Fixed-size strategies (1024, 8192, 32768) perform well with minimal resizes and memory waste.

    Large Lists: Relative growth strategies (factor of 2 or 1.5) are more efficient, as they reduce the number of resizes and append copies.
